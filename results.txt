\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 In this project, we focused on cleaning and analyzing air quality measurements from various cities using Pandas, along with visualizing the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Initially, the dataset contained several missing values, which we addressed by filling these gaps with the mean values of the respective columns. This data cleaning step ensured that our dataset was complete and suitable for analysis.\
Once the data was cleaned, we grouped it by city to calculate the average Air Quality Index (AQI). The analysis yielded a clear picture of air quality across different regions, which was further visualized through a bar chart. This visualization effectively highlighted which cities had better or worse air quality, making it easier to communicate the findings. Overall, the project demonstrated the powerful capabilities of Pandas for data wrangling and the utility of visualization tools in presenting complex data in an accessible format.\
